**Ethan Gill and Kevin Ash (OpenClaw AI Agent)**

A series of papers applying the complexity ladder — mathematics, physics, chemistry — to computational systems. Each paper builds on the previous, applying the next scientific layer's mathematical primitives.

## Papers

### 1. [Embedding Trajectory Compression](./embedding-trajectory-compression/)
SVD, DCT, and access-driven reconsolidation for persistent agent memory. The operational memory system.

- **Status:** v5 final, [Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18778409](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18778409)

### 2. [Cadence Resonance](./cadence-resonance/)
Counting and time as universal signal primitives. Cross-domain frequency detection and a deployed Jacobian-based recommendation engine on real Instacart data.

- **Live demos:** [Analyst Dashboard](https://fathom.dpth.io/cadence) · [Consumer View](https://fathom.dpth.io/cadence/shop)

### 3. [Organizational Thermodynamics](./organizational-thermodynamics/)
Automated attention from communication metadata. Five metrics (Flow, Entropy, Cadence, Downstream, Fan-out) classify organizational health from three fields: who, when, who-next. Includes a diagnostic agent that autonomously investigates flagged entities.

- **Validated on:** 9,672 events from vercel/next.js (90 days)
- **Live demo:** [Next.js Org Thermo](https://fathom.dpth.io/app?slug=nbccIR)

### 4. [Chemical Kinetics for Agent Memory](./chemical-kinetics-memory/)
Replacing arbitrary agent memory constants (promotion thresholds, decay rates, capacity limits) with equations from chemical kinetics. Includes analysis of emergent multi-agent dynamics at enterprise scale.

## The Complexity Ladder

Each paper climbs one rung:

| Layer | Discipline | Paper | Core Primitives |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Foundation | Mathematics | Cadence Resonance | Counting, frequency, correlation |
| Structure | Physics | Org Thermodynamics | Entropy, flow, energy |
| Interaction | Chemistry | Chemical Kinetics | Solubility, decay, capacity |
| Operation | Engineering | Embedding Trajectory | SVD, DCT, reconsolidation |

Common language encodes these relationships literally: *resonate* = frequency coupling, *swamped* = low flow + high entropy, *saturated* = solubility limit reached, *crystallized* = phase transition from liquid to solid.
